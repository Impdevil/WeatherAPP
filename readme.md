<h1>Put your cloths on the line!</h1>
<p>A weather app for telling you when the weather is right for putting cloths out on the line. saves me having to looking up the weather, if I can just get a notifcation that the weathers good enough for it the day before.</p>

<p> The idea is to then later add it to a smart mirror. This system will be running on a rpi, on my homelab.  </p>
