<h1>Put your cloths on the line</h1>
<p>a weather app for telling you when the weather is right for putting cloths out on the line. saves me having to looking up the weather, if i can just get a notifcation that the weathers good enough for it.</p>

<p> I know it sounds stupid, but hey, some one else might want this and I thought it would be a helpful project, then idea is to then add it to a smart mirror. This system will be running on a rpi.</p>
